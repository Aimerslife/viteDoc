### 工具是第一生产力

使用什么样的工具，就能做什么样的事。用工具的最佳实践来学习，往往能很快掌握一个领域 80%的知识。

重点是快速上手工具的能力，而不是死扣一个工具的细枝末节，投入与回报比例很低，也有工具过时的风险。


### Tools are the first productivity:

 what you do with the tools you use is what you do. Learning with the best practices of tools often leads to a quick mastery of 80% of a field's knowledge.

 The focus is on the ability to get up to speed with a tool quickly.Instead of sticking to the nitty-gritty of a tool, the ratio of input to return is low, and there is a risk of tool obsolescence.
